Problem Statement
1. Get the best Neural Network model for predicting Diabetes from the PIMA Diabetes dataset
2. Run the analysis for the best combination of the hyper parameters such as number of neurons, different optimizers, loss initializers & activators. (add on)
3. Combine the results for the above into "diabetes best.ipynb" to get the highest accuracy. (add on)
4. Evaluate the model by analyzing the ROC curve, F1 score, r squared value and  confusion matrix. (add on)
