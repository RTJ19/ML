This repository contains all my ML projects
The problem statements for each project will be mentioned in the README of that particular folder.
Statements marked as (add on) are problem statements created by myself, probably because I felt that it would add more value or make more sense to the data or give a better result etc.
Most of the codes have a good documentation which I believe gives a better readability. It also has extra sanity check lines or visualization graph which obviously wont be used during a deployment.
